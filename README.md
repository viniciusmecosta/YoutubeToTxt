This project allows downloading YouTube videos, converting them to MP3 audio, and automatically transcribing them.

## 📌 Code Structure

The code is organized into two independent classes:

### 1️⃣ `YouTubeDownloader`
- Responsible for downloading YouTube videos and converting them to 64kbps MP3 audio.
- To instantiate, provide the destination directory and optionally a cookies file.
- Cookies help avoid YouTube restrictions and allow access to private videos linked to the account.
- **Recommended extension for extracting cookies:** [Cookie Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/editor-de-cookies/ookdjilphngeeeghgngjabigmpepanpl).
- **Cookies format:** Netscape.
- To start downloading, use the `download_audio(video_links)` method, where `video_links` is a list of YouTube URLs.

### 2️⃣ `Transcriber`
- Responsible for transcribing the audio files generated by `YouTubeDownloader`.
- To instantiate, provide the directory where the audio files are stored.
- To start transcription, call `process_files()`.


## ⚠️ Requirements
- **Operating System:** It is recommended to use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook on a Linux platform.
- `ffmpeg` may cause issues on Windows, making the process more complicated.
- If you have a GPU, change `device="cpu"` to `device="cuda"` in the `Transcriber` class for better performance.

## 📂 File Structure

```

## 📌 Notes
- Transcription uses the **Faster-Whisper** model for greater efficiency.
- The code structure is modular and allows for easy adaptation.
